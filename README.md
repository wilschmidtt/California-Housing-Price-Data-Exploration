# California-Housing-Price-Prediction
* Use the California census data to build a model that predicts median housing price for any district in California
* Project was created to gain practice with discovery/visualization of data, preparing data for machine learning algorithms, selecting/training a model, fine-tuning the model, and launching the system
* This is a tutorial followed from chapter 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems* by Aurélien Géron
